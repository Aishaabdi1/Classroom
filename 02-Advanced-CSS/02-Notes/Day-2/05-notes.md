# Forms

HTML form elements have many default styles applied by the browser.

- Open [19-Ins_Form-Styles/index.html](../activities/19-Ins_Form-Styles/index.html) in live server
  - `input` elements have `cursor: text` by default
  - `button` has an `outline` property applied on `:focus`
  - `appearance` on `select` boxes is `auto`. Setting this to `none` removes any special styling added by the browser.
