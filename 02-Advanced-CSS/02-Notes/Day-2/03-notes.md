# Pseudo-classes

Using pseudo classes, we can style the different states that an element can be in.

- Explain Hover, Active, Focus
- Open 15-Ins_Pseudo-Classes/index.html in live server. Inspect in Chrome.
- Demonstrate `:hover`, `:active` and `:focus`

## Try this yourself

- Now try [16-Stu_Pseudo-Classes](../activities/16-Stu_Pseudo-Classes/README.md) in live server

## Questions to consider

- What elements can have a `:hover` pseudo-class added to them?
- What does `display:none` do to an element?

Comfortable with Pseudo classes?
